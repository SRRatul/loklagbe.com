## **Problem Statement**

Finding skilled service providers like electricians, plumbers, and drivers in Bangladesh is inefficient and unorganized. People rely on informal networks, leading to delays, inconsistent service quality, and security risks. Service providers face irregular work and lack a platform to connect with customers.

### **Challenges for Customers:**
- Difficulty finding reliable workers, leading to inconsistent quality.
- Time-consuming process for locating service providers.
- Safety risks from unverified workers.

### **Challenges for Admin:**
- Difficulty managing and verifying service providers.
- Tracking job assignments and ensuring timely service completion.
- Lack of centralized systems for handling customer complaints and feedback.
- Ensuring fair pricing and preventing disputes between customers and workers.
- Managing service availability and handling peak demand efficiently.

This problem is common in urban areas where demand is high. A digital platform can improve accessibility, security, and efficiency for both customers and service providers.
