1.	Problem statement:  
Finding skilled service providers like electricians, plumbers, and drivers in Bangladesh is often inefficient and unorganized. People rely on informal networks, leading to delays, inconsistent service quality, and security risks. At the same time, service providers struggle with irregular work and lack a platform to connect with customers.
Why is This Problem Significant?

For Customers:

●	Hard to find reliable workers, leading to inconsistent quality.
●	Searching for service providers takes time.
●	Safety risks due to unverified workers

For Admin:
●	Difficulty in managing and verifying service providers efficiently.
●	Tracking job assignments and ensuring timely service completion is challenging.
●	Lack of a centralized system to handle customer complaints and feedback.
●	Ensuring fair pricing and preventing disputes between customers and workers.
●	Managing service availability and handling peak-time demand efficiently.
This problem is especially common in urban areas, where demand is high. A digital platform can improve accessibility, security, and efficiency for both customers and service providers.
2.	Objectives:
●	Centralized Service Marketplace
 Create an online platform for easy booking of verified service providers.
 
●	Efficient Booking & Scheduling
 Automate bookings to reduce cancellations and delays.
3.	Proposed solution:
In order to solve the issues aforementioned, we are planning to incorporate the following engineering approaches in our project-

●	Technology Stack: 
Programming languages- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP.
Tools- VS Code, Xampp for database.
Database- MySql.




●	Core Features:
1.	Service Browsing: Easy navigation and search functionality to find desired services. Options for each service category.
2.	Service Provider Profiles: Detailed profiles of service professionals, including:
3.	Booking System:
a.	Calendar/Date and Time Selection
b.	Service Details
c.	Booking Confirmation
4.	Order Management: Tracking of service requests, from booking to completion.
5.	Customer Feedback: Customers can send messages based on the service provider works.
6.	Reviews and Ratings System: Ability for customers to rate and review service providers.


●	Innovative Aspects:
a)	Verified Service Providers – Ensures security and reliability through admin approval.
b)	Automated Booking System – Reduces cancellations and delays with scheduling tools.
c)	Comprehensive Order Tracking – Enhances transparency in service fulfillment.
d)	User Reviews & Ratings – Builds trust and improves service quality.
e)	Admin Control Panel – Enables full platform management, ensuring smooth operations.


4.	Methodology:
●	Software Development Methodology: 
Agile method.

●	System Architecture:
The whole system architecture of the proposed project is depicted in the following UML below-
 


●	Expected Challenges and Risks:
a)	Complex billing system: Various policies and types of services make it a complex task to handle.
b)	Complex feedbacking system: The system is getting feedback from different services. It will show to admin, and the admin will also reply. So it is a robust thing to handle for our systems’ backend.

5.	Expected Outcomes:
A user-friendly digital platform connecting customers with verified service providers for various home and professional services.

Expected Impact:
a)	Convenience – Quick and easy service booking.
b)	Security – Verified providers ensure safety and reliability.
c)	Transparency – Ratings and reviews improve service quality.
d)	Scalability – A structured marketplace for long-term growth.


6.	Tools and Resources Needed:
VS code, GitHub (version control).
